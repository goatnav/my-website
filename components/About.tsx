               Howdy! I’m a computer science student at Texas A&M University who enjoys building practical, well-designed software that people actually want to use.
               I chose to minor in Statistics to better understand what’s actually happening behind the data I work with. It helps me make smarter decisions when working with machine learning models, analytics, and understanding uncertainty.

            I’ve worked on projects ranging from full-stack web platforms to AI and robotics systems, including a multi-agent drone simulation project, a log analysis assistant, and a point-of-sale web app built with React and TypeScript. These projects have pushed me to think about both technical design and real user needs, and to take ideas from rough concepts to polished, working systems.

            Through my coursework, personal projects, and a software engineering internship at Hexagon, I’ve learned how to write clean, reliable code and work closely with others to turn ideas into real products. I’ve also learned how to debug effectively, adapt to new tools quickly, and take ownership of the work I’m responsible for.

            <br></br>
            <br></br>

Outside of tech, you’ll usually find me skateboarding, riding my motorcycle, hitting the gym, or working on my next side project.
